## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-20

### Breaking Changes
- **Command namespace simplified** — all `/acli.beads.xxx` commands renamed to `/acli.xxx` (e.g., `/acli.beads.constitution` → `/acli.constitution`)
- **Agents consolidated from 7 to 5** — `requirements` + `architecture` merged into `architect`; `quality` + `testing` merged into `qa`
- **Removed core modules** — `AgentMemory.ts`, `BeadsWorkflow.ts`, `LearningTemplates.ts` removed; memory management delegated to beads CLI (`bd`)
- **Removed redundant templates/skills** — 5 speckit skills and 6 beads templates removed; replaced by spec-kit bundled templates and beads workflow
- **Python mandatory** — spec-kit requires Python; `acli setup` exits with error if Python is not installed
- **Go dependency removed** — beads installs via brew or npm only; Go is no longer required
- **Enterprise tone** — all agent instructions and CLI output use formal professional language; emojis removed throughout
- **Config schema v2** — `.agent-framework.json` now includes `dependencies`, `enterprise`, and `promptsDir` fields

### Added
- **Setup command** — `acli setup` checks and installs all dependencies (spec-kit, beads, plugins) separately from `acli init`
- **Superpowers integration** — `acli init` installs 13 superpowers skills (TDD, systematic debugging, brainstorming, code review, git worktrees, etc.) as `.skill.md` files in `.github/skills/superpowers/`
- **Beads integration** — `acli init` runs `bd init` if beads CLI is available; graceful degradation with warning if not installed
- **Spec-kit plugins** — `acli setup` installs brownfield, fleet, and superpowers-bridge plugins via `specify plugin install`
- **Spec-kit directory structure** — `acli init` creates `.specify/templates/` and `.specify/specs/` directories for specification-driven development
- **8 new slash commands** — `/acli.run` (fleet lifecycle), `/acli.clarify`, `/acli.checklist`, `/acli.debug`, `/acli.critique`, `/acli.respond`, `/acli.finish`, `/acli.onboard`
- **Windows compatibility** — `where` vs `which` detection, npm beads fallback (no brew on Windows), pip without `--user` on Windows
- **Auto-install all agents** — `acli init` now installs all 5 built-in agents automatically

### Changed
- **5 agents total** — orchestrator, architect (requirements + architecture), security, development, qa (code review + testing)
- **Architect Agent** — combines spec-kit SDD phases (constitution, specify, clarify) with architecture design (patterns, ADRs, technical decisions)
- **QA Agent** — combines code quality review workflow with test generation and execution
- **Orchestrator Agent** — fleet-style 10-phase lifecycle with 3 mandatory human gates; agents array updated to `['architect', 'security', 'development', 'qa']`
- **Development Agent** — single qa handoff replaces separate quality and testing handoffs
- **Security Agent** — handoff to qa instead of quality
- **install.ts** — `BEADS_PROMPTS` → `PROMPTS`, `SPECKIT_SKILLS` → `SKILLS`, reduced skills list to 3 essential skills
- **init.ts** — complete rewrite with v2 config, dependency tracking, auto-agent-install, superpowers skills, beads initialization
- **setup.ts** — extracted from init.ts as shared setup module (~200 lines); handles spec-kit, beads, and plugin installation
- **list.ts / config.ts** — removed emojis from all output
- **package.json** — removed `boxen` dependency, updated keywords, added `types` field, added `prepare` script

### Removed
- **Migration command** — `acli migrate` and `src/commands/migrate.ts` removed
- **Old agent directories** — `requirements/`, `architecture/`, `quality/`, `testing/` deleted after merge
- **Go dependency** — `checkGo()` function and Go installer removed from setup
- **Dead code** — `getPrebuiltAgent`, `listPrebuiltAgentNames` from `agents/index.ts`; `validate()` and legacy config fields from `Agent.ts`
- **ITERATIVE_DEVELOPMENT.md** — content merged into README.md

## [1.0.10] - 2026-03-14

### Changed
- **Language-agnostic agent instructions** — all 6 specialist agents (Security, Architecture, Requirements, Quality, Testing, Development) now defer all language-specific configuration (linting rules, test commands, coverage targets, scanning tools, code patterns) to per-project `.specify/memory/quality-standards.md` and `.specify/memory/reference-architecture.md` rather than embedding hardcoded assumptions; agents fail fast and ask for these documents if they are missing
- **Security Agent** — removed hardcoded JavaScript/Python scanning commands and helmet.js configuration; agent now reads security scanning tools and header middleware from `quality-standards.md`
- **Architecture Agent** — replaced 4 TypeScript design pattern implementations with concise prose descriptions; pattern selection deferred to project architecture documents
- **Requirements Agent** — removed BeadsWorkflow TypeScript API call examples and workflow step code blocks; process guidance now expressed as plain language steps
- **Quality Agent** — removed 6 before/after JavaScript/TypeScript code pair examples and hardcoded tool commands; agent now reads linting and quality tooling from `quality-standards.md`
- **Testing Agent** — removed full Jest/Supertest/Playwright example test implementations; test framework and conventions now loaded from `quality-standards.md` and `testing-plan.md`
- **Development Agent** — removed Express/React/Prisma boilerplate code generation examples; implementation patterns deferred to `reference-architecture.md`

### Performance
- **~1,360 lines removed** from embedded agent instructions across all 6 agents, reducing per-invocation token consumption by approximately 6,000–7,000 tokens per full pipeline run
- Previous release (`1.0.9`) had already removed ~996 lines of example interactions; combined total across both releases: **~2,356 lines removed**

## [1.0.9] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Feature-Specific Folder Organization** — BEADS+ workflow now organizes all documents in feature-specific folders using pattern `.specify/specs/{ID}-{slug}/` (e.g., `001-user-auth/`, `002-api-integration/`) for better isolation and parallel feature development
- **Automatic Git Branch Creation** — `/acli.beads.specify` command now automatically creates a git branch with pattern `feature/{ID}-{slug}` for each new feature specification; graceful fallback if git is unavailable
- **Sequential Feature ID Generation** — Features are assigned sequential IDs starting from 001, automatically incrementing based on existing feature folders
- **Feature-Aware Document Paths** — All BEADS+ commands (`/acli.beads.plan`, `/acli.beads.tasks`, `/acli.beads.analyze`, `/acli.beads.implement`) updated to automatically identify and use feature-specific folder structure
- **Memory Summarization** — `getHandoverWithSummary()` method automatically summarizes large or old handovers to reduce context window usage; summaries are cached and preserve critical information (high-priority issues, test failures) while truncating low-priority details
- **Automatic Learning Extraction from Git** — `extractLearningsFromGit()` method scans commit history for fix/bug/security commits and automatically creates learnings with proper categorization, tags, and severity based on commit messages and changed files
- **Memory Pruning & Deduplication** — `pruneMemory()` method with three strategies: merge similar learnings (≥50% tag overlap), remove ineffective learnings (<30% success rate after ≥5 applications), and archive old learnings (>1 year); includes dry-run mode for safe preview
- **Learning Templates** — 13 pre-built templates for common issues (SQL injection, XSS, N+1 queries, flaky tests, memory leaks, etc.) in `LearningTemplates.ts`; `saveLearningFromTemplate()` method creates consistent learnings with variable substitution
- **Memory Features Usage Examples** — comprehensive example file (`examples/memory-features-usage.ts`) demonstrating all new memory system features with real-world scenarios
- **Enhanced Documentation** — updated `MEMORY_SYSTEM.md` with detailed documentation for all new features, usage examples, and best practices

### Changed
- **BEADS+ Workflow Organization** — All BEADS+ commands now work with feature-specific folder structure instead of flat file organization; each feature gets its own isolated folder for spec, plan, tasks, and testing-plan documents
- **Specify Command** — `/acli.beads.specify` now generates feature folder, assigns sequential ID, and creates git branch before writing spec document; includes feature metadata in spec.md frontmatter
- **Plan Command** — `/acli.beads.plan` loads spec from feature folder and writes plan.md to same folder; identifies correct feature automatically or accepts user specification
- **Tasks Command** — `/acli.beads.tasks` generates tasks.md in feature-specific folder with feature ID metadata header
- **Analyze Command** — `/acli.beads.analyze` validates consistency across all documents within a feature folder; analysis report includes feature identification
- **Implement Command** — `/acli.beads.implement` executes tasks from feature-specific folder with full feature context; pre-flight checks identify correct feature folder

### Fixed
- **Unicode character compilation errors** — replaced box-drawing characters (─, ┌, └) with ASCII equivalents (-, +) in all agent instruction strings
- **Emoji character compilation errors** — replaced emoji markers with ASCII text equivalents ([DONE], [FAIL], [TEST], >>, [TASK], [DOC]) in handoff blocks across all 7 agents
- **Template string syntax errors** — escaped triple backticks (\`\`\`) inside template strings to prevent premature template closure
- All agent files (OrchestratorAgent, ArchitectureAgent, DevelopmentAgent, TestingAgent, CodeQualityAgent, RequirementGatheringAgent, SecurityAgent) now compile successfully without TypeScript errors

## [1.0.8] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Testing Plan document** (`testing-plan.md`) — `/acli.beads.plan` (step 8) now creates `.specify/specs/###-feature-name/testing-plan.md` with unit/integration/E2E test suites mapped to user stories, coverage targets, test data requirements, test run commands, and a **Manual Testing Steps** section for the human to verify the feature end-to-end
- **Manual Testing Steps in every handoff block** — all 7 agents now end every handoff with a rich `✅ WHAT WAS DONE / 🧪 MANUAL CHECK FOR YOU / 🔀 HAND OFF TO` block; development and testing agents include step-by-step manual test instructions the human can follow before the next agent takes over
- **Manual Testing Steps section in handover template** — `templates/beads/handover.template.md` now includes `## Manual Testing Steps` with setup commands, numbered steps, expected results, and failure symptoms

### Changed
- `TestingAgent` Project Context now loads `.specify/specs/###-feature-name/testing-plan.md` before writing any tests; if it doesn't exist, the agent asks @architecture to create it via `/acli.beads.plan`
- Orchestrator inline handoff examples updated to the richer block format including work summary and human check steps
- Phase 4 (PLAN) deliverables updated to reflect the four documents now produced: `plan.md`, `reference-architecture.md`, `quality-standards.md`, `testing-plan.md`



### Added
- `/acli.onboard` slash command prompt — reverse-engineers an existing project into three foundational BEADS+ documents: `constitution.md`, `reference-architecture.md`, and `quality-standards.md`
- `speckit-onboard.skill.md` skill — methodology guide for the onboarding process, including exploration strategy, inference rules, and update vs. create semantics
- **Reference Architecture document** (`reference-architecture.md`) — `/acli.beads.plan` now creates `.specify/memory/reference-architecture.md` alongside `plan.md`; serves as the canonical architecture reference for all agents and all future features
- **Quality Standards document** (`quality-standards.md`) — `/acli.beads.plan` and `/acli.onboard` now create `.specify/memory/quality-standards.md` with language/framework-specific linting rules, test standards, error handling patterns, and performance targets derived from the actual tech stack
- **Handover Protocol** — all 7 agents (orchestrator, requirements, architecture, development, quality, security, testing) now include explicit instructions to create a `.specify/handovers/YYYY-MM-DD-{from}-to-{target}.md` document before every handoff, using the existing `templates/beads/handover.template.md`
- **Project Context loading** — all 7 agents now include a mandatory "Project Context" section instructing them to load `constitution.md`, `reference-architecture.md`, and `quality-standards.md` (where applicable) before starting any task, and to flag conflicts before proceeding

### Changed
- `/acli.beads.plan` execution steps expanded from 6 to 8: steps 6 and 7 produce `reference-architecture.md` and `quality-standards.md` respectively
- `CodeQualityAgent` now mandates loading `.specify/memory/quality-standards.md` at the start of every review; every rule in that document is enforced
- `TestingAgent` now loads `quality-standards.md` for test framework, coverage thresholds, and run commands
- `install.ts`: `acli.onboard.prompt.md` added to `BEADS_PROMPTS`; `speckit-onboard.skill.md` added to `SPECKIT_SKILLS`

## [1.0.6] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- `handoffs` frontmatter attribute now serializes as objects with `label`, `agent`, `prompt`, and optional `send` fields per VS Code agent spec
- Added `HandoffConfig` interface to `Agent.ts`
- Updated YAML serializer to correctly render object arrays as YAML block mappings
- Orchestrator agent now has `handoffs` declared (was missing), enabling VS Code to present handoff buttons
- All sub-agents now include `orchestrator` as a handoff target so control can return after each phase
- Replaced `invokeAgent()` pseudocode in orchestrator instructions with real handoff protocol

## [1.0.5] - 2025-07-15

### Added
- 7 speckit skill files in `templates/skills/` (speckit-constitution, speckit-specify, speckit-plan, speckit-tasks, speckit-analyze, speckit-checklist, speckit-implement) — auto-discovered by VS Code from `.github/skills/`
- `installSpeckitSkills()` function; Speckit skills are now installed automatically alongside BEADS+ prompts
- `/acli.create.agent` slash command prompt — interactively scaffolds a new `.agent.md` file in `.github/agents/`
- `/acli.create.skill` slash command prompt — interactively scaffolds a new `.skill.md` file in `.github/skills/`

### Changed
- Prompt install path changed from `.github/copilot/` to `.github/prompts/` (correct VS Code discovery path)
- `acli create agent` and `acli create skill` CLI commands replaced by `/acli.create.agent` and `/acli.create.skill` Copilot Chat slash commands
- Skills are no longer listed in `tools` arrays — they are auto-discovered by VS Code and referenced by name in agent instructions

### Removed
- `acli create <type>` CLI command and `src/commands/create.ts` module

## [1.0.4] - 2025-07-09
