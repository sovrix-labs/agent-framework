# Examples

## Full Lifecycle: Build a Feature

This example walks through the complete specification-driven workflow for adding a search feature.

### 1. Start the workflow

```
/acli.run Add full-text search to the product catalog with filters and pagination
```

The orchestrator will guide you through all 10 phases automatically. At each human gate, you review the artifacts and approve or request revisions.

### 2. What gets created

```
.specify/
  memory/
    constitution.md           -- project principles (created once)
    reference-architecture.md -- architecture reference
    quality-standards.md      -- quality rules
  specs/
    001-product-search/
      spec.md                 -- feature specification
      plan.md                 -- technical plan
      tasks.md                -- task list
      analysis.md             -- consistency analysis
      checklists/
        security.md
        accessibility.md
        performance.md
```

### 3. Implementation loop

For each task, the orchestrator runs:
1. `@development` implements the task
2. `@qa` reviews via `/acli.critique`
3. `@qa` runs tests
4. If issues found: `/acli.respond` to fix, then re-review
5. If clean: mark done, next task

## Onboarding an Existing Project

```
/acli.onboard
```

The brownfield onboarding scans your codebase and produces:
- Constitution with principles derived from your actual code
- Reference architecture mapping your real directory structure
- Quality standards extracted from your linter/test config

## Debugging a Bug

```
/acli.debug Users get a 500 error when uploading files larger than 10MB
```

The debug workflow:
1. Captures the symptom precisely
2. Forms ranked hypotheses
3. Tests each systematically
4. Implements minimal fix with test coverage
5. Suggests prevention measures

## Code Review

```
/acli.critique src/services/payment.ts src/services/auth.ts
```

Produces a structured review checking:
- Spec alignment (does it match what was specified?)
- Plan conformance (correct architecture layer?)
- Constitution compliance (follows project principles?)
- Security (OWASP Top 10 checks)
- Test coverage

## Branch Completion

```
/acli.finish squash
```

Runs pre-completion checklist, cleans up debug artifacts, drafts conventional commit messages, and recommends merge strategy.

## Creating a Custom Agent

```
/acli.create.agent
```

Interactive prompts guide you through:
- Agent name and description
- Platform target (VS Code or GitHub Copilot)
- Tools and agent references
- Handoff configuration
- Instructions template

The result is a `.agent.md` file in `.github/agents/`.

## Using Individual Phases

### Constitution (project setup)

```
/acli.constitution
```

Creates the project constitution -- the single source of truth for how the project is built. All agents respect it.

### Specification (what to build)

```
/acli.specify Add OAuth2 login with Google and GitHub providers
```

Creates a technology-agnostic spec with user stories, acceptance criteria, and P0-P3 priorities.

### Clarification (resolve unknowns)

```
/acli.clarify
```

Identifies ambiguities in the spec and asks targeted questions (max 5) with suggested answers.

### Planning (how to build)

```
/acli.plan
```

Creates the technical plan with file structure, ADRs, and testing strategy.

### Quality Checklists

```
/acli.checklist all
/acli.checklist security
```

Generates domain-specific checklists that become gates during implementation.

### Task Breakdown

```
/acli.tasks
```

Creates a dependency-ordered task list with test requirements for each task.

### Consistency Analysis

```
/acli.analyze
```

Cross-references spec, plan, and tasks to find gaps and conflicts.

### Implementation

```
/acli.implement
/acli.implement start from TASK-005
```

Implements tasks one at a time with the Dev -> Critique -> Test review loop.
